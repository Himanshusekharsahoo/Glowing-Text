<h1>The text-shadow Property:
    The text-shadow property takes multiple values, representing the horizontal offset, vertical offset, blur radius, and color of the shadow.
    For a glowing effect, we’ll use multiple shadows with different colors and sizes.
    Creating the Glowing Effect:
    To make text glow, we’ll define two sets of shadows: one for the initial state and another for the glowing state.
    The initial shadow has a smaller blur radius and a neutral color (e.g., white).
    The glowing shadow has a larger blur radius and a vibrant color (e.g., pink or blue).
    Animating the Shadows:
    We’ll use CSS animations (keyframes) to alternate between the initial and glowing states.
    The animation smoothly transitions the text-shadow property from the initial values to the glowing values and back.</h1>
